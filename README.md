user story:
AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers

again using people in the field as a resource to guide and give suggestions project was still a challenge. In fact what is being turned in is what I believe to be a fully coded piece but I believe I am missing a small section to get the quiz to work properly. I wanted to submit something so it does not seem like I am not doing the work. I will continue to tweak and edit to see if I can get it actually working
